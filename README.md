#  UDACITY NANODEGREE DATA ANALYSIS PROJECTS
### This degree consisted of three steps:
1. The Data Cleaning
2. The Data Wrangling
3. The Data Visualization


First, I learnt how to clean a dataset (No-Show Appointment), In this project I learnt how to answer questions on how to improve patient attendance using the information of different patients.


Secondly, I learnt how to wrangle data from a Twitter account using API (WeRateDogs). Here, I learnt how to request for DEVELOPER API, learnt about json files, and how to draw insights from a twitter profile by asking questions, writing codes that answer the question and testing to confirm the question was properly answered (Data Interpretation). I also learnt how to write an informative report from the wrangled dataset to give the readers a clear description of my findings.


Lastly, I learnt Data Visualization using python (Proper Loan Dataset). Here, I learnt how to give insights from a dataset by following step by step procedures. This was one of the most eye opening project. First, individual attributes was visualized(Univariant), then two attributes were visualized together to further explain their relationship to the insight i need to draw(Bivariant). Then 3 or more of the attributes(Multivariant) were further compared and analysed to show their relationship and how they give very clear insight on the dataset investigation. I also learnt how to prepare a slide presentation of my findings for easy understanding, as the aim of the project was to provide a solution for the organisation.
